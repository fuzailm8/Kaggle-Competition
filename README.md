# Kaggle-Competition---Box-Office-Revenue-Prediction
This project describes my step-by-step approach to one of Kaggle's most popular competitions - the TMDB box office revenue prediction, where I ranked in the top 14% globally. 

I have compiled this walk-through article in the form of an IPython/jupyter notebook to hopefully showcase my complementary skillsets in programming, statistical modelling and data presentation. In a way, I wanted to let the reader know my thought process and problem solving approach for an essential data science problem.  

What if you could somehow know the secret ingredient to making a blockbuster? 'Will this movie work?' It's an age old question that no one really has the answer to. It could potentially lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank or unfortuanately even down the drain. My interest piqued by the real-world financial and business implications of this problem, I decided to try my hand and deep dive into the data that I was given. 

If you have any suggestions or comments on the notebook, please do feel free to get in touch with me at fuzailm@ucla.edu.
