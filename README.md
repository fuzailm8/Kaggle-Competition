# Kaggle-Competition---Box-Office-Revenue-Prediction
This project describes my step-by-step approach to one of Kaggle's most popular competitions - the TMDB box office revenue prediction, where I ranked in the top 14% globally. 

I could not add the train.csv and test.csv with the 25MB upload limit on GitHub but the contents of the file are clearly visible in the notebook with each of the features briefly explained as well. 

I have compiled this walk-through article in the form of an IPython/jupyter notebook to hopefully showcase my complementary skillsets in programming, statistical modelling and data presentation. In a way, I wanted to let the reader know my thought process and problem solving approach for an essential data science problem.  

If you have any suggestions or comments on the notebook, please do feel free to get in touch with me at fuzailm@ucla.edu.
